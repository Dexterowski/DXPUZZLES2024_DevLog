# The history of DX PUZZLES

When I was younger - about 12-13 years old I started to get interested in game developing. My favourite game was Half-Life. I don't remember excatly why and how I started to creating custom maps, but when I tried it I wanted to create more. I never have been a creative person. It was so interesting for me. 

Some time later I found mod for Half=Life which was called [Sven-Coop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sven_Co-op). Now it is a standalone game. This mod just added a possibility of cooperation in playing Half Life storyline.   

This game was so simple and fun. All PC's was able to run this. The requirements was very low. There was no needed a high-end PC to play this. All you really needed was a group of friends and some free time.

If you finished Half-Life campaing, you will able to download more custom maps made by a community. [Sven Coop Map Database](https://scmapdb.wikidot.com) still exists to this day. You can choose something for yourself and your friends from among 1550 maps. There is so much different map categories to play. Puzzles, mazes, climbing, survival, scary and many more.

That was it. When I found this mod (*as I mentioned above, now it is a standalone game*), I found this website with custom maps - I thought that I wanted to give people more custom content with my own ideas, but I was never a good mapper.

{{< alert "info" >}}
Mapper - the person who creates custom maps for games. That's an ancient word. Now someone like that is called **LEVEL DESIGNER**

As you can see I started to make my own custom maps for Sven-Coop. They was ugly as fuck and with time of gameplay for about 5 minutes. But I wanted to create more.

I also tried to create maps for Counter-Strike 1.6 (*it was also a mod for Half Life*). I had to get knowledge from somewhere so I found a polish forum called "hlmaps.noskill" or something like that. I created account and as young guy which want to create "big things" started to asking on forum instead of reading tutorials.

Because I get to this mapping forum I met my first "internet friends". They were different from the people I had contact with at school. We had the same approach to life, the same view of the world. I knew that these were the people I wanted to talk to, they were interested in the same thing as me - they were interested in level design, whether for Half Life or Counter-Strike. 

Two of them are for this day into game development - one guy is making his own games on Unity, second one is author of one of competetive pool maps in CS:GO (now CS2)

We quickly became familiar with each other. We always wanted to create something togheter. We tried to create own mods for Half-Life. Yeah, one was called "2012" as you can see on the screenshot above. I don't remember what was the storyline

> *We're posting our progress on YouTube. My friend modeled this ugly AA12 and I coded it. Yes, I instead of making maps, I was into coding in C++ in Half-Life.* 


{{< alert "warning" >}}
Starting your C++ learning with editing existing Half Life SDK code was not a good idea because I still feel the impact of it to this day. I will recommend to start learning from basics, then try to edit someones code.

## Secret City series

On mapping forums I also met another guy. It was the same year - 2008. I found on Sven Coop Map Database map series called [Secret City](http://scmapdb.wikidot.com/mappack:secretcity-series).

These maps made me realize what I really wanted to do. We loved them. But why?

What was so distinctive about these maps, why were they so special?


Because they had a lot of secrets. You just spawned in a random building, without any objective, any hints. You have to mess around with this map. I remember when I was free-roaming at this map when I run it for the first time - I accidentaly pressed some hidden button in the wall and something opened. I messaged my friend quickly asking him to join the server to discover the rest of map. 

![Float Start](https://i.imgur.com/XbZvqPf.png#float-start) If I remember correctly there was no any tutorial, walkthrough, solution how to finish these maps on YouTube, We wanted to discover all and then make a walkthrough how to complete them



That was the point - no hints, just hunting for a secrets.

Now in 2024 Secret City saga has remastered version which I didn't play yet. 

We wanted to play more of this type maps but there is no more on database available maps like these ones.
