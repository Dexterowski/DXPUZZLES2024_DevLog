# The history of DX PUZZLES

When I was younger - about 12-13 years old I started to get interested in game developing. My favourite game was Half-Life. I don't remember excatly why and how I started to creating custom maps, but when I tried it I wanted to create more. I never have been a creative person. It was so interesting for me. 

Some time later I found mod for Half=Life which was called [Sven-Coop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sven_Co-op). Now it is a standalone game. This mod just added a possibility of cooperation in playing Half Life storyline.   

This game was so simple and fun. All PC's was able to run this. The requirements was very low. There was no needed a high-end PC to play this. All you really needed was a group of friends and some free time.

If you finished Half-Life campaing, you will able to download more custom maps made by a community. [Sven Coop Map Database](https://scmapdb.wikidot.com) still exists to this day. You can choose something for yourself and your friends from among 1550 maps. There is so much different map categories to play. Puzzles, mazes, climbing, survival, scary and many more.

That was it. When I found this mod (*as I mentioned above, now it is a standalone game*), I found this website with custom maps - I thought that I wanted to give people more custom content with my own ideas, but I was never a good mapper.

{{< alert "info" >}}
Mapper - the person who creates custom maps for games. That's an ancient word. Now someone like that is called **LEVEL DESIGNER**

As you can see I started to make my own custom maps for Sven-Coop. They was ugly as fuck and with time of gameplay for about 5 minutes. But I wanted to create more.

I also tried to create maps for Counter-Strike 1.6 (*it was also a mod for Half Life*). I had to get knowledge from somewhere so I found a polish forum called "hlmaps.noskill" or something like that. I created account and as young guy which want to create "big things" started to asking on forum instead of reading tutorials.

Because I get to this mapping forum I met my first "internet friends". They were different from the people I had contact with at school. We had the same approach to life, the same view of the world. I knew that these were the people I wanted to talk to, they were interested in the same thing as me - they were interested in level design, whether for Half Life or Counter-Strike. 

Two of them are for this day into game development - one guy is making his own games on Unity, second one is author of one of competetive pool maps in CS:GO (now CS2)

We quickly became familiar with each other. We always wanted to create something togheter. We tried to create own mods for Half-Life. Yeah, one was called "2012" as you can see on the screenshot above. I don't remember what was the storyline

*We're posting our progress on YouTube. My friend modeled this ugly AA12 and I coded it. Yes, I instead of making maps, I was into coding in C++ in Half-Life.* 


{{< alert "warning" >}}
Starting your C++ learning with editing existing Half Life SDK code was not a good idea because I still feel the impact of it to this day. I will recommend to start learning from basics, then try to edit someones code.
{{</ alert>}}

We also made [one map](https://gamebanana.com/mods/85613) for an Easter Mapping Competition which won. 

## Secret City series - main inspiration

On mapping forums I also met another guy. It was the same year - 2008. I found on Sven Coop Map Database map series called [Secret City](http://scmapdb.wikidot.com/mappack:secretcity-series).

These maps made me realize what I really wanted to do. We loved them. But why?

What was so distinctive about these maps, why were they so special?


Because they had a lot of secrets. You just spawned in a random building, without any objective, any hints. You have to mess around with this map. I remember when I was free-roaming at this map when I run it for the first time - I accidentaly pressed some hidden button in the wall and something opened. I messaged my friend quickly asking him to join the server to discover the rest of map. 

{{< gallery images="https://scmapdb.wdfiles.com/local--files/map:secretcity-4/secretcity4-3.jpg,https://scmapdb.wdfiles.com/local--files/map:secretcity-4/0-secretcity4-2.jpg,https://scmapdb.wdfiles.com/local--files/map:secretcity-6/secretcity6b6__31-01-16_13-42-40.jpg,https://scmapdb.wdfiles.com/local--files/map:secret-city-x/secretcityx_sorry.png">}}

These maps were filled with mysterious, disturbing, creepy strange looking places. Just clean surrealizm.  This made them so special, unique and memorable. When I looked at them, I often wondered what the author had in mind, what he had in mind to create such a thing, what the story was behind it... Why does it look like this?

![Float Start](https://i.imgur.com/XbZvqPf.png#float-start) If I remember correctly there was no any tutorial, walkthrough, solution how to finish these maps on YouTube, We wanted to discover all and then make a walkthrough how to complete them

{{% /bs/clearfix %}}

That was the point - no hints, just hunting for a secrets.

> Now in 2024 Secret City saga has [remastered version](http://scmapdb.wikidot.com/map:secretcity-saga-remastered) which I didn't play yet. According to description it will not look like these first ones maps. They added into them some "hints for noobs". I must play to give a feedback.

We wanted to play more of this type maps but there is no more on database available maps like these ones.

{{< alert-heading >}}Fun fact:{{< /alert-heading >}}
There is a still active [discord server](https://discord.gg/aZYQQK5R) for Sven-Coop developers. In 2024 people are still making maps for this game

**GoldSrc** (an engine of Half Life/Sven Coop) had it's own vibe but it was very limited. 

## Source Engine - Half-Life 2, Garry's Mod

{{% bs/clearfix%}}
![Float Start](https://archive.org/download/garrys-mod-9/garrys-mod-9.png?width=300px#float-start)
Some time later I played a Half Life 2. It is such a good game. Then I discovered [Garry's Mod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garry%27s_Mod). The history of GMod was the same as Sven-Coop. Firstly it was just a modification to Half-Life 2 and then it was published as standalone game developed by Facepunch Studios.

It was a definition of **Sandbox** game. You was able just to have fun with [Havok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havok_(software)) physics engine. Limitation was an imagination. GMod was highly moddable. You can make your own models, maps, tools, gamemodes and many more. The game was designed with modders in mind, providing them the [LUA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language)) scripting language. That was a "tool" which allowed you to create own gamemodes, weapons, entities and more. People started quickly to port content from other games, so we was able to play maps from Counter-Strike, Portal, Call of Duty and many more. You can also download player models like Lara Croft. There are tons of mods for it. It is the biggest [workshop on Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/app/4000/workshop/).

One thing didn't exist on the Garry's Mod Workshop - maps like Secret City. <u>There was also no co-op gamemode</u> which will allow you to play with friends Half-Life 2 storyline.

### First map - DX_CIRATS

![Center](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/573400471206060618/F7CDF261F7A3215D4340BAF9943F860F35082A81/?imw=5000&imh=5000&ima=fit&impolicy=Letterbox&imcolor=%23000000&letterbox=false?width=300px#center)

Base on that I wanted to create something similar but to Garry's Mod. I was 100% sure players gonna love it, and that's how I created my [first published map](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=299464215&searchtext=cirats) to Garry's Mod. I very liked rat-styled maps so I created new one based on my room where I lived. 

Originally it was uploaded and published onto [ToyBox](https://gmod.fandom.com/wiki/Toybox) which was replaced later by official Steam Workshop. I've lost map source files and if I wanted to reupload it to workshop I have been forced to upload it in the same condition as I had the package with the map - mainly missing materials and models. Map is also heavliy un-optimized so it causes big FPS drops on high-end PCs

To today's day it has 885 subscribers, 21 added to favs. I do not remember if this map has ending. Maybe some day I will play it with some friends and check what it looks like.

Making those type maps had one big problem - Garry's Mod in sandbox gamemode allowed players to cheat very easliy. They can turn on noclip (flying) with one key press or godmode. So I had to take this into account in my second production
