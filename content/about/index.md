My name is Kacper. I'm 28 years old. I decided to create this website because for a long time I've been focusing on my project DX PUZZLES, which I've been thinking aboout and working on for many years. I am not sure what this should look like but I decided to create a devlog. Maybe my thougths and solutions will be useful to someone. Game development is my hobby. On a daily basis my work is creating videos on YouTube about delivering food from apps like Glovo, Uber Eats, etc. Delivering food was also my first job in life and it has stayed that way until now. I didn't want to becaome a game developer or anyone else involved in IT because I believe that if it became my main job, it would no longer bring me the same satisfaction and fun.
